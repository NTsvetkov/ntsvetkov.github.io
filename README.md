Get some help while playing wordle, for a better wordle

# How to use

- Start by making a guess for your wordle game, once started, start adding the relevant keys in the fields
- First five fields represent the corresponding place of the letters (green letters), checked box before the field tells the system that value exists at this place, whereas, unchecked box suggests that value doesn't exist at this place
- Next add the letters that exist in the word but not in correct place, yellow letters
- Add the letters that don't exist in the word, gray letters
- Words to try section tells the next words that you should try to get more insights about letters and,
- Possible words sections shows the possible matches

# Caveat

- Be mindful while entering letters that exist and don't exist(yellow and gray one's) as wordle may show same letter in gray as well as yellow(in case of not repeating letters)
- Currently there is no capability to handle multiple letters that don't exist at a place
